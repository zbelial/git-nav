# git-nav
Git commands to checkout preview or next commit.

Inspired by [here](https://gist.github.com/hutusi/e4f32e2bcd8d53ec86de8254ab0d5127).

## How to use
Add execute permission to these scripts and copy them to the directory where `git` is in. 

Then you can use `git first` to checkout the first commit of a repository.  Other commands can be used in a similar way.
